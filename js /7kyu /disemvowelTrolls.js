// Trolls are attacking your comment section!
// A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
// Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
// For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
// Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.
// Vowels are [A,E,I,O,U], 

// Objective
// 1. Remove the characters a, e, i, o, u from the sentence 
// Psuedocode
// 1. Loop through the String
// 2. filter out the characters 

const disemvowel = str => str.replace(/[aeiou]/gi, "");

console.log(disemvowel('Hello World My namE is TomIsIn and i lOve to cOde'))
