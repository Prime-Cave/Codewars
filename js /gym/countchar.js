// 1. String Compression
// You are given a string containing only uppercase letters. Your task is to implement a function called `compressString` that compresses the string by counting the consecutive occurrences of each letter and returning a new compressed string.
    
//     The compressed string should consist of each letter followed by its count. If a letter appears only once consecutively, you should include the count.
    
//     Example:
//     `compressString("AAAABBBCCDAA"); // should return "A4B3C2D1A2"`
//     `compressString("XYZ"); // should return "X1Y1Z1"`
